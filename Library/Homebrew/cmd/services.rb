          Manage background services with macOS' `launchctl`(1) daemon manager or
          Linux's `systemctl`(1) service manager.

          If `sudo` is passed, operate on `/Library/LaunchDaemons` or `/usr/lib/systemd/system`  (started at boot).
          Otherwise, operate on `~/Library/LaunchAgents` or `~/.config/systemd/user` (started at login).

          [`sudo`] `brew services` [`list`] (`--json`) (`--debug`):
          List information about all managed services for the current user (or root).
          Provides more output from Homebrew and `launchctl`(1) or `systemctl`(1) if run with `--debug`.

          [`sudo`] `brew services info` (<formula>|`--all`|`--json`):
          List all managed services for the current user (or root).

          [`sudo`] `brew services run` (<formula>|`--all`|`--file=`):
          Run the service <formula> without registering to launch at login (or boot).

          [`sudo`] `brew services start` (<formula>|`--all`|`--file=`):
          Start the service <formula> immediately and register it to launch at login (or boot).

          [`sudo`] `brew services stop` (<formula>|`--all`):
          Stop the service <formula> immediately and unregister it from launching at login (or boot).

          [`sudo`] `brew services kill` (<formula>|`--all`):
          Stop the service <formula> immediately but keep it registered to launch at login (or boot).

          [`sudo`] `brew services restart` (<formula>|`--all`):
          Stop (if necessary) and start the service <formula> immediately and register it to launch at login (or boot).

          [`sudo`] `brew services cleanup`:
          Remove all unused services.
